##INTRODUCTION

On August 2, 2022, Nancy Pelosi - the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States - visited Taiwan during a tour of Asia, accompanied by five other Democratic Party members. She did so despite repeated warnings from China and the risk of already strained relations between the United States and China becoming worse. As is already known, Taiwan is a contested island that is constantly at the risk of being ‘reunified’ with the Chinese mainland under the latter’s One China Policy. The visit expectedly came with a serious set of ramifications - the People’s Liberation Army of China deployed a destroyer and guided missile frigate in the waters surrounding Taiwan. In this project, we seek to understand the reactions to the contentious visit by Speaker Pelosi by two primary stakeholders - the media and common public, what impact said event had, and what kind of narratives emerged from it. 


##METHODOLOGY

In order to understand the impact of Speaker Pelosi’s visit and the narratives promoted by different actors, we use different digital methods on two different datasets on the CorText platform. The first is a corpus of media articles on the visit published between 30th July 2022—when debates regarding her potential visit started, to 10th August 2022—a week after the visit itself. The second dataset is a corpus of tweets published in the same period that mention Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. For each section, we also analyse a smaller corpus of solely Chinese and/or Taiwanese sources to better reflect the nuances of the themes discussed. Each analysis involves the use of digital media analysis techniques such as Demography, Epic Epoch, Topic Modeling, Terms Extraction and Network Mapping scripts.
