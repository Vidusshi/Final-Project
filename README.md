### INTRODUCTION

On August 2, 2022, Nancy Pelosi - the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States - visited Taiwan during a tour of Asia, accompanied by five other Democratic Party members. She did so despite repeated warnings from China and the risk of already strained relations between the United States and China becoming worse. As is already known, Taiwan is a contested island that is constantly at the risk of being ‘reunified’ with the Chinese mainland under the latter’s One China Policy. The visit expectedly came with a serious set of ramifications - the People’s Liberation Army of China deployed a destroyer and guided missile frigate in the waters surrounding Taiwan. In this project, we seek to understand the reactions to the contentious visit by Speaker Pelosi by two primary stakeholders - the media and common public, what impact said event had, and what kind of narratives emerged from it. 


### METHODOLOGY

In order to understand the impact of Speaker Pelosi’s visit and the narratives promoted by different actors, we use different digital methods on two different datasets on the CorText platform. The first is a corpus of media articles on the visit published between 30th July 2022—when debates regarding her potential visit started, to 10th August 2022—a week after the visit itself. The second dataset is a corpus of tweets published in the same period that mention Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. For each section, we also analyse a smaller corpus of solely Chinese and/or Taiwanese sources to better reflect the nuances of the themes discussed. Each analysis involves the use of digital media analysis techniques such as Demography, Epic Epoch, Topic Modeling, Terms Extraction and Network Mapping scripts.

## SECTION I

### Analysis of Media Articles 

In today’s fast-paced world, the readership of printed newspapers has gradually declined. Print media outlets have also adapted to the changing times and increasingly publish articles online as well. Information can now be found in a multitude of ways online, be it through social media networks, official Twitter handles or webpages of online publications. In fact, 72% of EU internet users aged 16-74 read online news sites, newspapers or news magazines. Therefore, the importance of the digital word in shaping views and perceptions has drastically increased, and the delivery of online news has the power to sensationalise information. This is especially evident in the case of our topic, where a short visit—what some might consider to be a blip in the grand scheme of events happening around the world—generated such a magnitude of media coverage. In the days leading to Speaker Pelosi’s visit, worldwide media delivered an hour-by-hour coverage of the events unfolding, both reporting on and feeding the frenzy that people believed could lead to a third world war. Therefore, understanding the narratives propagated by media articles is essential in our analysis of the reactions to the visit.  In this section, we use different digital methods to break down the topics and themes discussed in media articles, how they relate to each other, and understand how the publication sources—the political alignment of the outlets—factor into what information is being promoted. We also analyse a smaller subset of the corpus comprising Chinese and Taiwanese media sources to better understand the reactions and narratives present there.
